# Motortestbench
- communication loss shutdown von Servo Seite aus

## Done
- Motor control with Start/Stop
- PDO integration (DC Bus Voltage, Temperatures)
- Safety features (Fault detection, Emergency disconnect)
- Connection robustness (Reconnection after CAN loss)
- NMT Heartbeat receiver (monitoring drive state)
- kg-based torque input with motor conversion
- Temperature and voltage telemetry display

## Future (on hold pending clarification with manufacturer)
- Watchdog heartbeat consumer (drive auto-stop on host connection loss)
